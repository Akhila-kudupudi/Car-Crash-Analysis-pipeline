# üöó Car Crash Analysis Pipeline 

This project is a full-stack data analytics pipeline developed for car crash analysis. It focuses on analyzing car crash data from Montgomery County, Maryland, to uncover key insights, perform geospatial analysis, and build predictive models that identify primary factors contributing to driver-at-fault incidents.

## Project Objectives

- **Analyze crash trends** using historical data
- **Visualize** accident hotspots through geospatial mapping
- **Preprocess and clean** raw data using PySpark
- **Connect MongoDB Atlas and Databricks** to scale data handling
- **Engineer features** relevant for predictive modeling
- **Build machine learning models** to classify at-fault crashes
- **Evaluate model performance** using metrics like accuracy and F1-score
